solve49
=======

a solution for https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/id904930186

the groovy script expects the count of tiles of one edge and calculates a solution via backtracking. 
I never got the program terminated for 7 (49 tiles), and only got a solution for 48 hits. The site is hosted at 
http://wondee.github.io/solve49.html and shows one of the results of the program.
